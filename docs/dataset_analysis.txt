  "title": "University_of_Notre_Dame",
  "context": "Architecturally, the school has a Catholic character. Atop the Main Building's gold dome is a golden statue of the Virgin Mary. Immediately in front of the Main Building and facing it, is a copper statue of Christ with arms upraised with the legend \"Venite Ad Me Omnes\". Next to the Main Building is the Basilica of the Sacred Heart. Immediately behind the basilica is the Grotto, a Marian place of prayer and reflection. It is a replica of the grotto at Lourdes, France where the Virgin Mary reputedly appeared to Saint Bernadette Soubirous in 1858. At the end of the main drive (and in a direct line that connects through 3 statues and the Gold Dome), is a simple, modern stone statue of Mary.",

=== Analyzing Text Corpus Dataset (Shakespeare) ===

1. Basic Information:
Number of rows: 1
Size in memory: 0.96 MB

2. Features (Column Types):
text: Value(dtype='string', id=None)

3. Dataset Info:
Description: 40,000 lines of Shakespeare from a variety of Shakespeare's plays. Featured in Andrej Karpathy's blog post 'The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks': http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/.

To use for e.g. character modelling:

```
d = datasets.load_dataset(name='tiny_shakespeare')['train']
d = d.map(lambda x: datasets.Value('strings').unicode_split(x['text'], 'UTF-8'))
# train split includes vocabulary for other splits
vocabulary = sorted(set(next(iter(d)).numpy()))
d = d.map(lambda x: {'cur_char': x[:-1], 'next_char': x[1:]})
d = d.unbatch()
seq_len = 100
batch_size = 2
d = d.batch(seq_len)
d = d.batch(batch_size)
```
