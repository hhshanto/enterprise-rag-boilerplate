Here's a list of the 10 tests and their purposes in plain English:

1. **test_initialization**
   - Verifies that the DataEmbedding class is properly initialized with all required components: HuggingFace token, ChromaDB client, and the correct embedding function model.

2. **test_directory_structure**
   - Ensures all necessary directories (root, data, and embedding directories) exist and are accessible for the embedding process.

3. **test_data_loading**
   - Checks if the Shakespeare text corpus can be loaded successfully from disk and contains actual data.

4. **test_collection_creation**
   - Verifies that ChromaDB successfully creates a collection named "text_embeddings" to store the embedded documents.

5. **test_embedding_storage**
   - Confirms that embeddings are actually being stored in the ChromaDB collection and the collection isn't empty.

6. **test_metadata_structure**
   - Validates that each embedded document has the correct metadata structure, specifically checking if the "source" field is set to "shakespeare".

7. **test_batch_processing**
   - Tests if the system can handle multiple queries simultaneously and returns the correct number of results for batch operations.

8. **test_id_format**
   - Ensures that document IDs are formatted correctly following the pattern "text_[number]" for proper document tracking.

9. **test_semantic_search**
   - Verifies that semantic search functionality works by checking if meaningful results are returned for a sample query.

10. **test_error_handling**
    - Tests the system's ability to handle error cases, specifically checking if it properly handles empty queries.

These tests collectively ensure that:
- The system is properly configured
- Data can be loaded and processed
- Embeddings are correctly generated and stored
- Search functionality works as expected
- Error cases are handled appropriately
- The entire pipeline from data loading to search works end-to-end
